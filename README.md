# Lumi

Lights, camera, action!

Look your best during a conference call. Lumi transforms your Nanoleaf devices into a key light! 

Lumi will automatically engage your Nanoleaf into key light mode when your webcam becomes active and return your device 
back to its original state once the call is complete.

## About

Lumi was originally created to solve a need I had. As with any side project, it went deeper and then I created
a [Nanoleaf Swift library](https://github.com/reddavis/Nanoleaf).

So I decided to open source Lumi as an example app of how to use a few of the libraries I've created to help my own app development:

- [RedUx](https://github.com/reddavis/RedUx) RedUx is a modern Swift implementation of the redux pattern that takes advantage of Swift's newer asyns/await APIs.
- [Asynchrone](https://github.com/reddavis/Asynchrone) - Extensions and additions to AsyncSequence, AsyncStream and AsyncThrowingStream.
- [Papyrus](https://github.com/reddavis/Papyrus) - Offline first apps.
- [Nanoleaf](https://github.com/reddavis/Nanoleaf) - Swift API client for Nanoleaf smart lights.

## Requirements

- macOS 12.3

## App Store
